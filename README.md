# Final-Year-Project-API
This repository will hold an API which will be used in my final year project. The API is meant to act as a gateway to a microservice which is contacted via HTTP e.g couch db. 

#Running 
This service is built  on Python 3.6.
### Install  and start CouchDB

```

If you are doing a fresh run of the project, you will need to install dependancies. To do so run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
To run the API locally clone the repo and run 
```
